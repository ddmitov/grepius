grepius
=======

Grepius is an improvised desktop search utility based on good old grep command.<br>
Edit and then execute 'context' shell script if you want your search word(s) displayed in terminal within their context.<br>
Edit and then execute 'filelist' shell script if you want your search results displayed in a browser as a hyperlinked list of files.<br>
Edit and then execute 'cnvpdf' shell script if you want to make .pdf.txt files from .pdf files in order to search within their contents. You need 'pdftotext' utility.<br>
Documentation is missing and the author is to be blamed... But the scripts were usefull for me and probably will help others too.
